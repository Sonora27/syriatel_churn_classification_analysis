## Business Question

SyriaTel has a significant issue with customer churn, which means that a customer will stop doing business with SyriaTel in the very near future. Major cellphone companies have churn rates that rarely exceed 2% in modern times, yet SyriaTel's churn rate is over 14%! 

I have been contracted by SyriaTel to create a model that predicts customer churn in order for them to improve their ability to retain their customers.

## Repository Structure
* pngs -- folder that contains visualizations that were vital to my analysis
* jupyter_notebooks - contain three notebooks: EDA_STAT_TEST, knn_modeling, dt_rf_modeling
* README.md
* presentation.pdf -- contains pdf version of project presentation

## Data

For my analysis, I utilized a dataset that was given to me by SyriaTel on their customer churn data. This dataset had 3,333 observations and 20 features. After performing data cleaning, statistical testing, and modeling, I was able to pair this down to 13 features.

## Statistical Tests

After performing exploratory data analysis, there were a few hypotheses I wanted to test:

	* Are customers that have an international plan more likely to churn than customers who do not?
