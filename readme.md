# Business Question

SyriaTel has a significant issue with customer churn, which means that a customer will stop doing business with SyriaTel in the very near future. Major cellphone companies have churn rates that rarely exceed 2% in modern times, yet SyriaTel's churn rate is over 14%! 

I have been contracted by SyriaTel to create a model that predicts customer churn in order for them to improve their ability to retain their customers.
